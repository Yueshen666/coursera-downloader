# coursera-downloader

A command-line interactive coursera-downloader.

This project is based on 2 other projects:
  - [Coursera Downloader 1](https://github.com/coursera-dl/coursera-dl)
  - [Coursera Donwloader 2](https://github.com/jansenicus/www-coursera-downloader)

To run:
1. download the repo 
2. cd to the repo folder
3. type `python coursera-downloader.py` in your command line

You will then prompted to input your other options. By default, a folder with the course name will be created under the
`coursera-downloader` folder to host all the files downloaded from `www.coursera.org`.

The script is tested with Python3 and Mac Sierra OS.
No guarantee for the performance in other operating systems.
